## 2026-09-04 CST — Redwood-10 fixed registration + relaxed-anchor Gaussian edit

**User approval.** “效果非常好了 可以保存代码 提交到github上.” This is the
accepted result to preserve. Do not change the shared registration or Gaussian
parameters, regenerate upstream assets, or replace the 100k-prior carrier
without a new explicit experiment.

**Outputs.** The complete result root is
`workspace/relaxed_anchor_gaussian_redwood10_20260904`. For every sample
`01184, 05117, 05452, 06127, 06145, 06188, 06830, 07136, 07306, 09639`, the
registered prior is
`registration/<sample>/final/camera1_amplified_registered_100k.ply` and the
accepted prediction is
`gaussian/<sample>/decoded/partial_anchored_gaussian_decoded_100k.ply`.
Every prediction was checked to retain exactly 100,000 Pixal slots. The batch
manifest is `gaussian/batch_manifest.json`.

**Inputs.** The same root contains `inputs/partial/<sample>.ply`, saved-view
camera/depth/Qwen assets in `inputs/camera/<sample>/`, and GPT image,
Pixal input, GLB, sampled PLY and metadata in `inputs/pixal/<sample>/`.

**Upstream models and prompts.**

- Qwen model: `models/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511`; transformer:
  `models/nunchaku-qwen-image-edit/nunchaku_qwen_image_2511_balance_int4.safetensors`.
  Each full Qwen prompt follows exactly
  `生成一张图像，参考图1遮挡情况下的深度图，并遵循以下描述：完整的<label>，纯白背景`
  with labels `{rubbish bin, red chair, armchair, terracotta flower pot with
  leafy plant, table, red motorcyle, tricycle, leather sofa, red office trash
  can, Ergonomic Chair}` in the sample order above. Negative prompt is exactly
  ` `; true CFG is `4.0`; steps are `40`; input is `raw_depth.png`; Qwen seed,
  scheduler and backend are `UNKNOWN`.
- GPT clarity image prompt, model/version, seed, scheduler, CFG and negative
  prompt are `UNKNOWN` unless saved beside a retained input as `prompt.txt`.
  The fixed contract is clarity-only: preserve the Qwen camera, pose, scale,
  silhouette and observed part layout; do not rotate, rescale, recenter,
  mirror, add/remove parts, or alter articulated local geometry.
- Pixal3D: `models/Pixal3D-weights`; DINOv3:
  `models/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m`; MoGe-2:
  `models/moge-2-vitl/model.pt`; RMBG-2.0: `models/RMBG-2.0`. Frozen Pixal
  generation uses seed `42`, 1024 cascade, 12 sparse/shape/texture steps,
  sparse/shape guidance `7.5`, texture guidance `1.0`, 300k decimation target,
  2048 texture and 100k surface samples.

**Frozen inference.** Registration is the fixed native Pixal--MoGe analytic
initialization, two-camera bridge, coupled residual and Camera-1 amplified /
wide-tilt / final-tilt continuation. Gaussian editing uses Camera-1 plus six
positive-overlap signed-PCA virtual views; 8-neighbor graph, edge ratio `1.8`,
screening `.0015`, anchor/displacement caps `.075`, six self-protection views
with weight `.01`, protection exclusion `.10`, remote gain `1.0`, CG tolerance
`1e-5`, and 240 iterations. The decoder performs collision-free one-to-one
partial-anchor replacement. No GT/CD/EMD/category/sample-specific routing is
used by inference.

**Offline-only evidence.** After the batch was frozen, the 16,384-point FPS
audit with seed `6145` reported mean CD-L1/EMD `1.58197163 / 2.51144224`
(×10²). Per-sample results and protocol are under
`postfreeze_cd_emd/{metrics_samples.csv,metrics_summary.json,protocol.json}`.
These values are reporting-only and must not become a test-time selection gate.

## 2026-09-04 CST — `01184` scratch Qwen → GPT → Pixal end-to-end validation

**User approval.** “现在流程已经没问题了.” This confirms the scratch
upstream path is valid. Preserve its saved-view geometry and the fixed
registration/Gaussian parameters; do not replace them with a replay asset or a
metric-selected variant.

**Inputs and outputs.** Partial and GT are respectively
`data/redwood/partial/01184.ply` and `data/redwood/gt/01184.ply`. The complete
run is `workspace/mainline_upstream_smoke_20260904`: Qwen depth/semantic and
Camera-1 assets are in `semantic/01184`; GPT input and prompt are in
`pixal_input/01184`; Pixal GLB/100k prior/metadata are in `pixal/01184`;
registration ends at
`registration/01184/final/camera1_amplified_registered_100k.ply`; and the
approved complete prediction is
`gaussian/01184/decoded/partial_anchored_gaussian_decoded_100k.ply`.

**Models and exact generation record.** Qwen pipeline is
`models/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511`, transformer is
`models/nunchaku-qwen-image-edit/nunchaku_qwen_image_2511_balance_int4.safetensors`;
input is `raw_depth.png`, output is 512 px, true CFG `4.0`, steps `40`, and
negative prompt is exactly ` `. The exact Qwen prompt is
`生成一张图像，参考图1遮挡情况下的深度图，并遵循以下描述：完整的rubbish bin，纯白背景`.
Qwen seed, scheduler and backend are `UNKNOWN`. The GPT asset is
`pixal_input/01184/gpt_image.png`; its full prompt is recorded verbatim in
`gpt_refinement_prompt.txt`; model/version, seed, scheduler, CFG and negative
prompt are `UNKNOWN`. Pixal uses `models/Pixal3D-weights`, DINOv3
`models/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m`, MoGe-2
`models/moge-2-vitl/model.pt`, and RMBG-2.0 `models/RMBG-2.0`, with seed `42`,
1024 cascade, 12 sparse/shape/texture steps, guidance `7.5/7.5/1.0`, 300k
decimation, 2048 texture and 100k surface points.

**Post-processing and reporting.** The run uses deterministic 256-view
saved-camera selection, grayscale depth + OpenCV fill, Qwen completion, GPT
clarity edit, Pixal preprocessing, native Pixal--MoGe alignment, two-camera
bridge, Camera-1 continuation, and the fixed partial-anchored Gaussian edit
and decode. No GT is read before the final prediction. The offline 16,384-point
audit (seed `6145`) reported CD-L1×100 `1.16162859` and EMD×100 `1.80500858`;
these are reporting-only.

## 2026-09-05 CST — globally calibrated fixed registration/edit defaults

**Status.** User-directed calibration of the already fixed mainline. The
Qwen → GPT → Pixal assets, registration stage order, Gaussian edit/decode
algorithm, and 100k prior carrier are unchanged. Only two values are updated
globally for every sample: the final Camera-1 Sim(3) trust region is `1.0°`
and the saved/virtual positive-correspondence radii are `1.0 px`. There is no
sample/category branch, learned update, or inference-time GT/CD/EMD access.

**Outputs.** The complete candidate is
`workspace/fixed_mainline_calibration_20260905/combo_final100_pixel100`.
Its registration inputs are the ten final PLYs under
`workspace/fixed_mainline_calibration_20260905/registration_final100_replay/<id>/final/`;
the final predictions are
`combo_final100_pixel100/gaussian/<id>/decoded/partial_anchored_gaussian_decoded_100k.ply`.
All ten (`01184, 05117, 05452, 06127, 06145, 06188, 06830, 07136, 07306,
09639`) were verified to contain exactly 100,000 points. The no-override smoke
run is `workspace/fixed_mainline_default_smoke_20260905`; for `01184` both its
final registration PLY and decoded PLY are byte-identical to the selected
candidate.

**Inputs/models/prompts.** This calibration did not regenerate an image or a
3-D prior. It reuses the exact partial, Camera-1, Qwen/GPT/Pixal inputs from
`workspace/relaxed_anchor_gaussian_redwood10_20260904/inputs`; the complete
Qwen prompts, GPT prompt records, model paths, checkpoints, seeds, and upstream
generation parameters are therefore exactly those recorded in the preceding
2026-09-04 accepted Redwood-10 entry. New Qwen/GPT/Pixal generation prompt:
`NOT RUN`. New image/3-D generation seed, scheduler, CFG and negative prompt:
`NOT APPLICABLE`. Native registration uses the existing Pixal 100k prior plus
MoGe-2 `models/moge-2-vitl/model.pt` and RMBG-2.0 `models/RMBG-2.0` under the
same fixed two-camera route.

**Frozen numerical settings.** Standard/wide Camera-1 continuation remains
unchanged (32,000 points; wide trust region `1.0°`). The final continuation
uses levels `(0.010, 1.0°, 0.010)`, `(0.004, 0.35°, 0.004)`, and
`(0.001, 0.10°, 0.001)`. Gaussian edit/decode uses `1.0 px` for both saved and
virtual positive matches; six virtual views at 384 px; anchor/displacement
caps `.075`; 8-neighbour graph, edge ratio `1.8`, screening `.0015`; six
protection views, weight `.01`, exclusion `.10`; remote gain `1.0`; and CG
`1e-5/240`. Do not alter these values without a new complete global audit.

**Offline-only evidence.** The fixed 16,384-point audit with seed `6145`
reported CD-L1×100 / EMD×100:

| id | CD | EMD |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 01184 | 1.0610 | 1.7740 |
| 05117 | 1.6685 | 2.9317 |
| 05452 | 0.9441 | 1.5376 |
| 06127 | 2.3836 | 3.7654 |
| 06145 | 0.6561 | 1.0179 |
| 06188 | 1.2063 | 1.9679 |
| 06830 | 1.5183 | 2.7327 |
| 07136 | 1.2703 | 2.3600 |
| 07306 | 3.1936 | 3.9313 |
| 09639 | 1.7803 | 2.7671 |
| mean | **1.5682** | **2.4786** |

This improves the prior fixed baseline `1.5820 / 2.5114` on both metrics. The
metric file is `combo_final100_pixel100/metrics.{csv,json}` and is reporting
only; it was never read by registration or Gaussian editing.
